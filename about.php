        Ever since I can remember, I\'ve always been surrounded by technology.
        Being a child of the 90\'s, I got to see and experience many different
        changes in technology first-hand, and at a very young and 
        impressionable age. Although I\'ve only been coding for the past 5 
        years, my knowledge of and experience with computers is quite vast.
        I\'ve literally used every iteration of Windows! (now I feel old)

        After working for many years in the restaurant industry, I felt like I
        needed to make a change to something a little less physically taxing 
        (it\'s hard work!). While working full time and playing gigs on the 
        weekend with my band, I began attending Delaware Technical and
        Community College, studying Information Technology and Networking.
        After a couple of intense years, I received my Associates in Applied 
        Science in ITN in the Spring of 2020. During my time at school, 
        I took many different computer science and IT related courses. Some of
        my proficiencies include:

      <ul class="list-inline">
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C / C++</li>
        <li>OOP / Data Structures</li>
        <li>Android App Development</li>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS3 / Sass</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>React.js</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
        <li>VC (Git)</li>
        <li>LAMPs Stack</li>
        <li>Database Technology and Programming</li>
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>Windows 10</li>
        <li>VM Software (Hyper-V, ESXi)</li>
        <li>IT Support and Networking</li>
      </ul>

        Aside from my computer proficiencies, I am an extremely fast learner, 
        and absolutely love being challenged. I strive to better myself with 
        each coding or development project that I endeavor. I believe my 
        willingness to learn, open-mindedness and aspiration to succeed will 
        be a valuable asset to any employer.

      <p class="lead">
        Other than immersing myself in technology, I spend a lot of my spare 
        time writing and playing music. I\'ve been playing music for roughly 
        two decades, so I\'m always looking for ways to leverage my knowledge 
        of computing to create some interesting music (or devices - see my 
          <a href="https://natenasteff.com/projects.html">projects</a> 
        page). Some of my other hobbies include cooking, playing golf, casual 
        gaming, and bombing hills on my longboard, to name a few.
