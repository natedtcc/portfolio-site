#    <center> My Portfolio Site  ⚡️

___
<br/>
My portfolio website, written from scratch (and some Bootstrap) with 
HTML, CSS and a bit of PHP. I'm constantly changing it, but it's always
online. I plan on re-creating this site in React.js in the very near
future. <br>
<br/>
<br/>
This site is currently hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4, which has turned out 
to be a great hosting option, as well as an extremely capable development
environment. As I get better at web development, it seems the Raspberry Pi
impresses me more and more!
